## Welcome to the 709S C++ Style Guide

This is where you can refer to if you are a programmer for team 709S, or if you just like my coding style.

### 709S

Team 709S is currently a two-man team, with only one who programs. If you have any reccommendations, (hopefully not) complaints, suggestions, additions, or other comments about this style guide, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:ethanialw@gmail.com">ethanialw@gmail.com</a>
